## Next Steps
This project was built in a 36 hour hackathon and has many aspects that can be improved. Some planned upgrades are 
* Better educational descriptions for existing parsers
* RPC based parser plugins so parsers can be written in any language
* Additional parsers (Bitcoin Scripts / Bitcoin Tx / Generic RLP / etc.)
* Support for multiple parsers on a single input
* Better support for very large payload bodies
